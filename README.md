NOAA Satellite Pass Recorder

Automatically capture NOAA weather satellite imagery using an RTL-SDR, a tuned 137MHz turnstile antenna, and a Raspberry Pi.
Project Status

ðŸš§ Work In Progress ðŸš§

This project is actively under development. Contributors and testers welcome!
Overview

This system automates the recording and decoding of passes from NOAA weather satellites (NOAA-15, NOAA-18, and NOAA-19) as they orbit overhead, capturing valuable weather imagery directly from space.
Hardware Requirements

    Raspberry Pi (3B+ or newer recommended)
    RTL-SDR dongle
    137MHz turnstile antenna (optimised for APT signals)
    Appropriate cables and connectors

Software Components

    RTL-SDR drivers
    Scheduling system for satellite pass prediction
    Recording automation
    Signal processing for APT decode
    Image generation from decoded signals

Installation

// TODO :)

Usage

Current Features

    Satellite pass prediction
    Automated recording
    APT signal decoding
    Image processing
    Web interface (hopefully auto publish these to Github pages)
